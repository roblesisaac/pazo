 he do while loop should not be your first choice when writing an iterative solution. As a general rule, if you can solve the problem reasonably with a while loop then you should do that. With that being said, there is no reason why we can't practice it a little bit.
The factorial of a non-negative numbers is notated n!. Given a number like 5. The factorial is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which equals 120
Write a program that asks the user to input a non-negative number and then computes the factorial for this number. Use a do-while loop to solve the problem.

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
                
        System.out.println("Enter a number greater than 0");
        int num = in.nextInt();
        int factorial = 1;
        int i = 1;
        do {
          factorial *= i; // factorial = factorial * i
          i++;
        } while(i <= num);
       
        System.out.println("The factorial of " +num+ " is " + factorial); 
        
    }

}
