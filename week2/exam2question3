The do while loop should not be your first choice when writing an iterative solution. As a general rule, if you can solve the problem reasonably with a while loop then you should do that. With that being said, there is no reason why we can't practice it a little bit.
The factorial of a non-negative numbers is notated n!. Given a number like 5. The factorial is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which equals 120
Write a program that asks the user to input a non-negative number and then computes the factorial for this number. Use a do-while loop to solve the problem.


 Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("Please enter a non-negative number.");
        
        int num = in.nextInt();
        
        do(){
        
    }while(){
        
    }
    }
    
}
